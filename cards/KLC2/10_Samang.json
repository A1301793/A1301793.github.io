Atop this final layer lies Gimpala, a mysterious paradise rumored to offer eternal life and peace.\nSociety centers around preparing to take the journey to Gimpala; even those who won't, like the waterbound Hantua nymphs, lend what support they can. All of Simua helps raise children and prepare supplies for the journey ahead, ascenders tackle their challenge in tightly-knit teams, and failed ascenders return to the bottom to record what they have seen for future generations. The journey is also seen as a source of self-improvement and spiritual enlightenment, whether or not it succeeds.", "flavor_text": "[i][/i]", "pt": "", "special_text": "", "shape": "token", "set": "KLC2", "loyalty": "", "artist": "", "notes": "!Samang", "image_type": "png"}
