Offended and fascinated by the pride and zeal they exhibit, he chooses to follow them on their journey and torment them until they break.\nAs'hin sends trial after trial after the ascenders; some cannot overcome them and either retun or perish, but inspired by the determination of their leader Luningning, the rest persevere. Perplexed and enraged, As'hin confronts the team himself; however, the team makes short work of the overconfident fox, strengthened by their resolve and unity. As'han expects to perish, but Luningning extends mercy, grateful for the experiences that helped her and her team grow.\nHumbled by this mercy and touched by the sight of the ascenders' determination, As'hin decides he has been misguided; his torments should be for the purpose of not only tearing down the arrogant and weak, but to find and praise the truly strong and worthy. Spurred on by this epiphany, he sets off into the Eternities once again, now with a clearer purpose.", "flavor_text": "[i][/i]", "pt": "", "special_text": "", "shape": "token", "set": "KLC2", "loyalty": "", "artist": "", "notes": "!Samang\n!Ashan", "image_type": "png"}
