However, affirmation never came, and his desire for it was seen as a weakness; and in his home, weakness was something to be attacked under a misguided sense that it would help.\nYear by year, resentment grew inside the fox, and he sought to tear down his community for the arrogance and hypocrisy he saw inside them. Beneath suspicion due to his stature and reputation as an earnest man, As'hin studied his peers' weaknesses and prepared to exploit them, until finally, he had his chance. When he unleashed his master plan, none were spared; one by one, he mercilessly tore down everyone until they either admitted the error of hurting him or broke in utter despair. At the peak of his euphoria over his new power, As'hin's spark ignited.\nConvinced that this was a reward from his god for what he'd done, the vindicated As'hin set out into the eternities to test them in his god's name.", "flavor_text": "[i][/i]", "pt": "", "special_text": "", "shape": "token", "set": "KLC2", "loyalty": "", "artist": "", "notes": "!tag:Ashin", "image_type": "png"}
