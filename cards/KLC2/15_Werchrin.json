Nature has been harnessed to serve the people, and most of the world is covered in one large city-state. The small plane is ruled by a work-based, technically egalitarian society; while everyone is guaranteed the lowest basics of life by the democratic bureaucracy, hard work qualifies for more benefits, both material and political.\nAt least, this structure held until recently. A strange hysteria has begun to spread across the plane; first as merely abnormal levels of anxiety, then intensifying each day into more and more outright hostile and psychotic paranoia. Now, the world is littered with violence, looting, and general panic, and rumors speak of the people's nightmares stalking the streets in flesh.\nIn truth, the cause is man-made; the excavator Thomar dug too deep and awoke an old god of fear, who then conscripted the hapless man into servitude. He himself is promised freedom from fear... as long as he obeys.", "flavor_text": "[i][/i]", "pt": "", "special_text": "", "shape": "token", "set": "KLC2", "loyalty": "", "artist": "", "notes": "!tag:Werchrin", "image_type": "png"}
