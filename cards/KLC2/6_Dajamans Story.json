While its people's suffering fails to dissuade him from his own goals, he still helps some of the downtrodden.\nSaljan, who has rallied other victims like him into a gang in the shadows, catches wind of Dajaman's quest and invites Dajaman to his lair. There, he shares his version of events; true, but limited.\nAt first, Dajaman is unable to reconcile what he hears with the noble and selfless man he loves and almost falls into despair. In this moment of weakness, Saljan orders his subjects to attack; to crush Dajaman's heart, then his body, was his plan for revenge against his tormentor all along.\nThis suspicious act, however, stirs doubt in Dajaman's heart; after beating off his assailants, he continues his search, certain there's more to the story. In time, he uncovers Rheila's old journal and, with it, the troubled heart behind the deeds; and with it, the grim mindset his mate has descended to.\nVindicated, relieved, but still in sorrow for Rheila's fate, Dajaman steels himself and leaves to track down his love... whatever that may mean.", "flavor_text": "[i][/i]", "pt": "", "special_text": "", "shape": "token", "set": "KLC2", "loyalty": "", "artist": "", "notes": "!tag:Vasille\n!tag:Dajaman", "image_type": "png"}
