{"card_name": "Rheila's Story", "color": "", "rarity": "common", "type": "", "number": 9, "color_identity": "C", "cost": "", "rules_text": "In the depths of Vasille, a conclave of various doctors strives to understand life itself and stops at no moral limit to do so. Their leader, Moranc, learns of Rheila's medical prowess and, taking advantage of his grief and uncertainty, lures him to the inner circle with the promise that the skills they'll learn together will ensure he'll never lose a patient, or a mate, again.\nStarting from undeath and eventually graduating to live subjects, Rheila takes to studying the nature of life and death, gaining more and more insight and, with it, a sense of purpose and solace. Slowly, this blinds him to the suffering he inflicts and drowns out the pangs of guilt.\nThe results from one subject, Saljan, yield enough information to skyrocket Rheila's skills; however, the gruesome sight breaks through his layers of self-ignorance, making him confront what he has done and how low he has sunken. Rather than take this as a sign to amend his ways, Rheila instead concludes that nothing but his identity as a healer remains in him; with hollow resolve, he departs for the Eternities, now devoted only to his work... at all costs.", "flavor_text": "[i][/i]", "pt": "", "special_text": "", "shape": "token", "set": "KLC2", "loyalty": "", "artist": "AndreaCharlesta", "notes": "!tag:Vasille\n!tag:Rheila", "image_type": "png"}
