In that cause's name, they've roamed the Multiverse, preaching the message of healing through purging all that harms a world's natural course; however, when that message has failed, they've regretfully taken on the burden of sacred destruction by their own hand. All this, they did while only thinking of their god's will.\nOne world, however, shook Bahum's conviction; its unnatural state was meant to protect its people, and by restoring its natural course, Bahum doomed thousands to suffering and death. Lost in despair, Bahum sought their god's counsel... only to be told that what had happened was right. Unable to accept the answer, they roamed the Eternities, only to arrive on Veronia's soil.", "flavor_text": "[i][/i]", "pt": "", "special_text": "", "shape": "token", "set": "KLC2", "loyalty": "", "artist": "benzoix", "notes": "!tag:Bahum", "image_type": "png"}
