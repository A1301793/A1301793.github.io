To what end had they done their sacred work until then? To help whom? \nRoaming the world in search of answers, Bahum was attacked; in self-defence, they used their destruction magic to kill their assailant, the first true death Veronia had seen in centuries.\nThis was brought to the attention of Hollmont, a queen who wanted to save Veronia from its inevitable death by overpopulation; she approached Bahum with an offer of alliance and showed them the nature of the world.\nAfter contemplating all this, Bahum came to a conclusion; they had wanted, all along, to help people thrive in healthy worlds. And in a world like this... the only way to do that would be to save Veronia from itself. To destroy. To kill.\nArmed with new purpose and Hollmont's support, Bahum took on their mantle as destroyer once again.", "flavor_text": "[i][/i]", "pt": "", "special_text": "", "shape": "token", "set": "KLC2", "loyalty": "", "artist": "benzoix", "notes": "!tag:Veronia\n!tag:Bahum", "image_type": "png"}
