When his homeland failed to change, he fled to find a new life in Bant with his mate, Rheila. For a time, they had the peaceful life they'd sought, until a near-death experience triggered both men's sparks and separated them.\nOn his way to find his beloved, Dajaman slowly allowed himself to be more selfish in pursuit of his own happiness. Even then, he insisted on pacifism wherever he'd go; until one day, it resulted in fatal consequences for people he'd grown attached to.\nThis drove Dajaman to get over himself and train in the art of battle so he could protect what he cares for, including Rheila. To reconcile the need for battle with his own comfort and compassion, he chose to practice a nonlethal fighting style meant to end battles with no lasting harm.\nOnce he felt he'd become capable enough, Dajaman continued his search for Rheila, still hoping to live with his mate once again.", "flavor_text": "[i][/i]", "pt": "", "special_text": "", "shape": "token", "set": "KLC2", "loyalty": "", "artist": "", "notes": "!tag:Dajaman\n(ax the \"has been here before\" angle? reword intro blurb according to note)", "image_type": "png"}
