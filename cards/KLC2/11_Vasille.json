Its people, lost in the grips of planewide existential panic, were convinced by a charismatic new political movement that the Soul was disgusted by Vasille's weakness; that its people would need to become better, more refined, more worthy of its attention for it to return.\nSlowly, Vasille's culture changed. The wilds were walled off as \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cunsightly\u201d, and laws were bent and dissolved to favor the skilled and famous; eventually, law became something decided [i]by[/i] the skilled and famous. The people aspire for ever greater prestige, locked in endless competition and obsessed with impressing the elusive Worldsoul.
