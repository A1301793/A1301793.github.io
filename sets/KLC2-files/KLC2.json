Beneath suspicion due to his stature and reputation as an earnest man, As'hin studied his peers' weaknesses and prepared to exploit them, until finally, he had his chance.

As'han expects to perish, but Luningning extends mercy, grateful for the experiences that helped her and her team grow.\nHumbled by this mercy and touched by the sight of the ascenders' determination, As'hin decides he has been misguided; his torments should be for the purpose of not only tearing down the arrogant and weak, but to find and praise the truly strong and worthy.
